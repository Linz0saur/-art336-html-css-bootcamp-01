        <h1>Munchkin Cats</h1>
        <p>The Munchkin is a relatively new breed of cat characterized by its very <em><b>short legs</b></em>, which are caused by a naturally occurring genetic mutation. Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International Cat Association in 1995 with critics voicing concern over potential health and mobility issues.</p>
        
            <p>The Munchkin cat was first introduced to the general public in 1991 via a national network televised cat show held by <strong>The International Cat Association</strong><small>(TICA)</small>  in Madison Square Garden.Critics predicted that the breed would develop back, hip and leg problems similar to those that plague some Dachshunds.Amidst much controversy, the Munchkin was proposed as a new breed by foundation breeders Laurie Bobskill and Robert Bobskill of Massachusetts and accepted by <small>TICA</small> into its New Breed development program in September 1994. One veteran show judge resigned in protest, calling the breed an affront to breeders with ethics.The Munchkin achieved <small>TICA</small> Championship status in May 2003.</p>
            
        
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Shorter than  average legs</li>
            <li>Small to medium in size</li>
            <li>Average weight 4-9 pounds</li>
            <li>Playful</li>
            <li>People-oriented</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>Although the genetic mutation causing the short-legged trait in Munchkins has been referred to as <i>achondroplasia</i>,achondroplasia is typically associated with an enlarged head as well as short legs.This combination of features is not seen in Munchkin cats. The condition has sometimes been referred to as hypochondroplasia or pseudoachondroplasia.Small litter sizes when two munchkin cats are crossed indicate that embryos that are homozygous for the munchkin gene are non-viable.</p>
        <h3>Genetics</h3>
        <p>The munchkin gene is autosomal dominant.Homozygous embryos for the munchkin gene are not viable due to gene lethality, and do not develop in the womb. Only kittens that are heterozygous for the munchkin gene develop into viable short legged munchkin kittens.Because only heterozygous munchkin cats are able to pass on the gene, all litters with at least one munchkin parent have the possibility of containing kittens with the phenotypes: short-legged or normal-legged (referred to as non-standard munchkin), with the genotypes of Mm or mm, where M is the trait for short legs and m is the trait for long legs. A litter with two munchkin parents, Mm x Mm, have the chance of producing these offspring: 25% MM- a nonviable kitten, 50% Mm-short-legged, 25% mm- normal.</p>

        <h2>Web fonts</h2>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>A technique to download remote fonts was first specified in the CSS2 specification, which introduced the <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/" target="_blank">@font-face</a> rule.</p>
        <p>It was (and remains) controversial because using a remote font as part of a Web page allows the font to be freely downloaded. This could result in fonts being used against the terms of their license or illegally spread through the Web. TrueDoc (PFR), Embedded OpenType (EOT) and Web Open Font Format (WOFF) are formats designed to address these issues.</p>
        <p>Since the introduction of Internet Explorer 4, font embedding employing EOT has been used mainly for displaying characters in writing systems that are not supported by default fonts. Use on English-language Web sites was virtually non-existent. With the releases of Firefox 3.5, Opera 10 and Safari 3.1, usage employing other formats is expected to increase.</p>
        <h3>File formats</h3>
        <p>By using a specific CSS @font-face embedding technique it is possible to embed fonts such that they work with IE4+, Firefox 3.5+, Safari 3.1+, Opera 10+ and Chrome 4.0+. This allows the vast majority of Web users to access this functionality. Some commercial foundries object to the redistribution of their fonts. For example, Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones says that, while they &ldquo;...enthusiastically [support] the emergence of a more expressive Web in which designers can safely and reliably use high-quality fonts online,&rdquo; the current delivery of fonts using @font-face is considered &ldquo;illegal distribution&rdquo; by the foundry and is not permitted.</p>
        <p>Naturally this does not interfere with fonts and foundries under free licenses.</p>
        <h4>TrueDoc</h4>
        <p><a href="http://www.monotype.com/libraries/bitstream" target="_blank">Bitstream</a> developed   <strong>TrueDoc</strong>, the first standard for embedding fonts. TrueDoc was natively supported in Netscape Navigator 4, but was discontinued in Netscape Navigator 6 and Mozilla, because Netscape could not release Bitstream's source code. A WebFont Player plugin was available for Internet Explorer, but the technology had to compete against Microsoft&rsquo;s Embedded OpenType fonts, natively supported since version 4.0.</p>
        <h4>Embedded OpenType</h4>
        <p>Internet Explorer has supported font embedding through the proprietary Embedded OpenType standard since version 4.0. It uses digital rights management techniques to help prevent fonts from being copied and used without a license. A simplified subset of EOT has been formalized under the name of CWT <em>Compatibility Web Type, formerly EOT-Lite</em></p>
        <h4>Scalable Vector Graphics</h4>
        <p>Web typography applies to SVG in two ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>All versions of the SVG 1.1 specification, including the SVGT subset, define a font module allowing the creation of fonts within an SVG document. Safari introduced support for many of these properties in version 3. Opera added preliminary support in version 8.0, with support for more properties in 9.0.</li>
            <li>The SVG specification lets CSS apply to SVG documents in a similar manner to HTML documents, and the @font-face rule can be applied to text in SVG documents. Opera added support for this in version 10, and WebKit since version 325 also supports this method using SVG fonts only.</li>

        </ol>
        <h4>TrueType/OpenType</h4>
        <p>Linking to industry-standard TrueType (TTF) and OpenType (TTF/OTF) fonts are supported by Mozilla Firefox 3.5+, Opera 10+, Safari 3.1+, Google Chrome 4.0+. Internet Explorer 9+ supports only those fonts with embedding permissions set to installable.</p>
        <h4>Web Open Font Format</h4>
        <p>WOFF has been supported by Mozilla Firefox 3.6+, Google Chrome 5+, Opera Presto, and is supported by Internet Explorer 9 (since March 14, 2011). Support is available on Mac OS X Lion's Safari from release 5.1.</p>
        <h4>An example of a CSS @font-face setup:</h4>
        <p><code>@font-face { font-family: 'Journal'; src:url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.woff') format('woff'), url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.svg#Journal') format('svg'), url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.ttf') format('truetype'), url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.eot'), url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; }</code></p>
